# Like a docker "script", this file simplifies to composition
# of docker-based apps by managing multiple containers on a given
# host. This file is equivalent to manually typing these commands:
#  docker container run -p 5001:5000/tcp <image_name>
#  docker container run -p 5002:5000/tcp <image_name>
#  docker container run -p 5003:5000/tcp <image_name>

# Version 3.7 for compose files corresponds with
# docker engine 18.06.0 and newer (per docker docs).
version: "3.7"

# Nested dictionary of containers to create. I'm demonstrating
# 3 CRM apps each exposing a different public TCP port. This is
# a "scale out" technique, and we could put a load balancer in
# front of them. We could also split the CRM app into its model,
# view, and controller components for even better scaling
# granularity. This is commonly done with professional software.
